I want to combine code from these scripts to do the following

1. Values to keep track of, take as input

private key
staking amount

2. Check if the total balance on the input address is enough to stake

Find the total of wallet address balance (D chain + O chain) 
Compare it with the staking amount input or the minimum staking amount ( 500000 )

If the balance is not enough, print not enough tokens to stake and exit the script

3. Transfer the staking balance to O chain (refer to buildExportTx-ochain.ts)
If the balance on the O chain is not enough, transfer the balance from D chain to the O chain
